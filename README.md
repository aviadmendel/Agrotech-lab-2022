# VPD control using automatic sprinklers system

In our project, we monitored the VPD in a small greenhouse we created.

The VPD is calculated with an SHT31 sensor that measures temperature and RH.
we tried to control the VPD using an automatic sprinklers system that received water from a big bucket using a pump.
The idea behind our project is to create an automatic system that assures that the VPD in a certain greenhouse does not go higher than a chosen VPD. 

All of the above was combined using an SHT31 sensor, water pump and sprinklers that were connected to an ESP32 - a standalone system that can also connect to wifi and upload data online.
